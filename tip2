    <h3>Write It Down:<h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Write down the things you are worried about, why you are woried about them, and how can you deal with them.</li>
         <li>Write down the things you are proud of/thankful for and why you are proud of/thankful for them. It will help you to focus on good things in live.</li>
       </ul>
     <h3>Slow Down:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Stop what you are doing at the moment and breath.</li>
         <li>Just take a break for a couple of minutes, have some rest and continue doing what you were doing before or start a new task and come back to the old one whenever you're ready.</li>
       </ul>
     <h3>Change Your Thinking:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>It si not that easy to change your set of mind, however you cannot get stressed out unless you believe your own negative thoughts.</li>
         <li>For example, when you start stressing about not finishing your project on time, your mind builds a case for why what you believe is going to happen will happen — and this can be paralyzing. So, when combating negative thinking patterns, come up with specific examples to counter the stressful thoughts. Think instead of concrete ways that you can create the time to work on a project, and how your previous line of thinking isn’t accurate. </li>
       </ul>
     <h3>Lower your goals:</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>No, we’re not talking about being a slacker. Actually if you lower your goals, you’ll achieve more. It can help to relieve stress and boost academic success.</li>
         <li>Instead of setting your goal to be getting the highest grade in the class, set a goal to feel satisfied with your performance.</li>
         <li>Do not race with others, race with yourself.</li>
