  <h3><b>On This Page:</b></h3>
  <p id = "onthispage"><b>On this page you are going to find helpful information about long term mental health issues and difficulties people can face in their everyday life.</b></p>
  <p  class = "mh_info"><b>Living with mental illness is not easy. It is a consistent problem without a clear solution. While treatments like medication and psychotherapy are incredibly helpful, sometimes people experiencing mental health conditions need to do more day-in and day-out to feel good or even just okay.</b></p>
  <p class = "mh_info"><b>Some common self-help suggestions people receive are to exercise, meditate and be more present, which are helpful and work for many people. However, other proven methods aren’t mentioned as often. Many of them are quick and simple techniques that can easily be added to daily routines.</b></p>
  <p class = "mh_info"><b>Finding the right coping mechanism takes time and patience, but it can enormously impact how you feel. If you haven’t had success with techniques you have tried, or you have looking to add a few more to your toolkit, here are seven tips you can try to cope with long term mental health difficulties.</b></p>

  <h3 class = "mh_titles"><b>Radical Acceptance:</b><h3>
  <p class = "mh_info"><b>Radical acceptance is completely and totally accepting something from the depths of your soul, with your heart and your mind. Included in this definition is the idea that no matter what, you cannot change a situation. For example, imagine a tornado is coming your way. Obviously, you cannot do anything to stop the tornado, that is not possible. But if you accept the fact that it is coming, then you can act, prepare and keep yourself safe. If you sit around trying to will the tornado to stop or pretend that there is no tornado, you are going to be in real trouble when it comes.</b></p>
  <p class = "mh_info"><b>The same applies to mental illness. You cannot change the fact that you have a mental illness, so any time you spend trying to get rid of it, or pretend it does not exist is only draining you of valuable energy. Accept yourself. Accept your condition. Then take the necessary steps to take care of yourself.</b></p>
