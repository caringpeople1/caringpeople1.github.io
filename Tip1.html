  <p>
  <li> Take a deep Breath. Inhale for two seconds and exhale for 4 seconds. </li>
  <li> Count to 10 while breathing and make sure your eyes are closed. </li>
  <li> Let your thoughts go, at this moment don't think just feel.</li>
  <li> Focus on one sound and listen to it.</li>
  <li> Do not forget to breath.</li>
  <li> If you are sitting choose a comfortable position. It is best to put your feet on the floor and your hands on your lap.</li>
  <li> If you are lying down, relax your legs, arms and body. Face your palms to the ceiling.</li>
