         <li>Find a place where you can be alone to recompose yourself.</li>
         <li>You can take a trip to the bathroom to relax. Sometimes being away from the situation that is causing your stress can help clear your head. </li>
         <li>If it's too overwhelming ask if you can go home for the day. Sometimes you need to take a break at home so you can come back to school calm and collected</li>
