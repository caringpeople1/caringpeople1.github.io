    <h2>Relationships</h2>
    <h3><b>On This Page</b></h3>
    <p id = "onthispage"><b>This page is really important! Here you are going to find helpful information about healthy relationships, that is probably going to help you keep your stress level low when it comes to any type of relationship, weather it&#39;s your friends, your family members, your coworkers, or your partner. The tips below on this page are going to help you prevent from making mistakes in the future.</b></p>

    <p class = "r_info"><b>When it comes to our physical and mental health, strong relationship bonds may truly be the best medicine. Strong social networks may lengthen survival in elderly men and women, with good friends being even more likely to increase longevity than close family members. However, building strong relationship bonds with your family members is important as well.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>The closer we get to someone, the more invested we become in their emotions and behavior. We are far more likely to be reactive to our best friends or our loved ones. When they aren&#39;t feeling or acting quite themselves, they can incite feelings of frustration, judgment, competitiveness, or hurt in us.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>How can you avoid a falling out with someone you&#39;ve long trusted and cared about? Start by accepting the fact that you can only change yourself. And, almost always, fixing a friendship is a matter of fixing yourself.</b></p>

    <h3 class = "r_titles"><b>Be Honest:</b></h3>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>Relationships built on false build-ups or phony facades are only as good as their foundation. Superficial relationships often fizzle over time. To achieve a solid friendship/love relationship/etc., you have to be honest with each other. Being able to offer and receive feedback from someone you trust is a gift that can easily be overlooked.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>Setting aside your ego and being willing to let someone know you and ask questions of you is invaluable. Friends for example, are likely to ask the tough questionsâ€”&#8223;Why do you think you&#39;re attracted to that person?&#8221; or, &#8223;Do you think you might be feeling jealous or hurt in this situation?&#8221; Having a friend, a partner, or a family member who can tell it to you straight will help you know yourself better. Being able to reciprocate further challenges you to live with honesty, directness, and integrity.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>There is no way to feel more connected to someone than to open yourself up to them. Plus, keeping an honest dialogue helps prevent you from building up cynicism and boiling over in a moment when you feel triggered.</b></p>

    <h3 class = "r_titles"><b>Repair Misattunements:</b></h3>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>When you know someone well, you&#8217;re familiar with their strengths as well as with their weaknesses. And so, just as you know how to cheer them up, you know exactly how to tear them down. In moments of tension, we can let things slip out that are far more hurtful to our closest ones because they come from us.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>No one is perfect. We are all sure to mess up at times, but when we do, we have to set pride aside and repair the situation. Being honest shouldn&#8217;t be about being cruel. Finding a balance where you can say what you think without being parental, defining, or judgmental is important for keeping a level of trust between you and your friend/partner/coworker/family member.</b></p>

    <h3 class = "r_titles"><b>Make Time and Show Appreciation:</b></h3>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>In any relationship, we can start to impose certain expectations on others that set us up to feel hurt or disappointed. Don&#8217;t be quick to pick apart people. Accept that they are human and that they will make mistakes.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>We may show our love or respect in one way, whether through affection, favors, or gifts, but we shouldn&#8217;t necessarily expect the same from them. Don&#8217;t assume what people are thinking. Check it out instead. And accept that you could be wrong about their viewpoint, every individual possesses a sovereign mind and their own perceptions of the world. They may, in turn, have a very different way of expressing their feelings or showing that they care and it is very inportant when it comes to any type of relationship.</b></p>

    <h3 class = "r_titles"><b>Choose Compassion Over Cynicism:</b></h3>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>A good rule of thumb when it comes to our relationships is to care more about doing what&#8217;s right than being right. When you get to know a person, you get to know their worst traits, and it&#8217;s easy to become cynical toward those negative aspects of their personality. It&#8217;s far more preferable to be compassionate. Compassion keeps us vulnerable instead of tough and guarded, or seeing the world through a negative lens.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>For instance, toddlers as young as age two get joy from seeing others helped. The first study to suggest that altruism is intrinsically rewarding even to very young kids, and that it makes them happier to give than to receive.</b></p>
    <p class = "r_info"><b> Compassion, then, is its own reward, as it leaves us feeling good within ourselves regardless of how out relationship partner may be behaving. Being honest and straightforward without being cynical is perhaps the most important quality of a good friends/couples/coworkers/classmates/family members/etc.</b></p>

    <h3 class = "r_titles"><b>TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS:</b></h3>
    <p class = "r_info"><b>Even though most of the times you can still change the unpleasant situation you might have between you and your partner, there might be specifically complicated situations where your relationship might go in the wrong direction. We call this type of relationships toxic. It might be so hard to walk away, however your mental and physical health is more important than somebody else&#8217;s bad attitude.</b></p>
