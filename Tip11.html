         <li>Try and see if your friends are available to hang out. A good conversation can distract you form what might be stressing you out.</li>
         <li>If they are not able to hang out with you, try calling or texting a friend. You can tell them why your feeling stressed. It helps to get it out even if the other person is just listening.</li>
         <li>If you don't want to talk about what is making you stressed then you can try and make future plans with your friends. This will give you something to look forward too in the future. </li>
